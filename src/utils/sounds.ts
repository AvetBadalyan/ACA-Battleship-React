/**
 * @fileoverview Sound effects using the browser's Audio API.
 *
 * Sounds are short pre-recorded files in src/assets/sounds. We import each
 * file so Vite bundles and cache-hashes it, then keep one Audio object per
 * sound and a small playSound() function that plays the requested one.
 * currentTime is reset first so the same sound can retrigger immediately
 * (e.g. rapid shots).
 *
 * INTERVIEW NOTES:
 * - No classes / no `this`: just an object of Audio instances + functions.
 * - Files are imported (not hardcoded URLs) so the bundler resolves the
 *   correct hashed path at build time.
 * - play() can reject (e.g. before the first user interaction); we swallow
 *   that rejection so it never crashes the game.
