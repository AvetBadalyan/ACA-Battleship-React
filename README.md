```

### Key Design Patterns

| Pattern            | Usage                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |

| **State Machine**  | Game phases and AI hunt/target modes     |
| **Factory**        | Object creation functions                |
| **Pure functions** | Board and AI logic kept side-effect free |

## 🤖 AI Algorithm Explained

The AI uses the classic **Hunt/Target** algorithm, implemented as a two-mode
state machine:

- **Hunt mode**: fire at a random untried cell until something is hit
- **Target mode**: on a hit, queue the four adjacent cells and fire at them
  in turn to sink the ship
- On sinking a ship, it clears its queue and returns to hunt mode

This is meaningfully smarter than random guessing (it finishes ships it
finds) while staying simple enough to reason about and explain. A natural
next step would be to detect ship orientation after two in-line hits and
prioritise that direction — left out here to keep the logic simple.

### Common Interview Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: Why did you choose Zustand over Redux or Context API?</strong></summary>

Zustand offers several advantages:

1. **Simpler API** - No boilerplate, no action types, no reducers
2. **Better Performance** - Components only re-render when their specific subscribed state changes
3. **No Provider Required** - Just import and use the hook
4. **Built-in Persistence** - Easy localStorage integration
5. **TypeScript Support** - First-class type inference

For a game with frequent state updates (every shot), performance is critical.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: How does the AI decide where to shoot?</strong></summary>

It uses the **Hunt/Target** algorithm, a two-mode state machine:

- **Hunt mode**: fire at a random untried cell. O(n²) to gather untried
  cells, O(1) to pick one.
- **Target mode**: once a cell is hit, its neighbors are pushed onto a FIFO
  queue. The AI drains that queue, firing at each valid neighbor, so it
  finishes off any ship it finds instead of wandering off.
- On a sink, it clears the queue and returns to hunt mode.

The state (`mode`, `targetQueue`) lives in an `AIHuntState` object that's
updated immutably after every shot. A natural extension would be to detect
ship orientation after two in-line hits and prioritise that direction; I
left it out to keep the code simple to read and explain.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: How do you handle state immutability?</strong></summary>

All state updates create new objects using:

- Spread operator: `{ ...object, property: newValue }`
- Array.map(): `array.map(item => ({...item}))`

This is crucial for:

1. React's change detection (reference equality)
2. Preventing accidental mutations
3. Enabling features like undo/redo (future)

Example from `processShot()`:

```typescript
// Create entirely new board
const newBoard = board.map((row) => row.map((cell) => ({ ...cell })));
// Then modify the copy
newBoard[pos.row][pos.col].state = 'hit';
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: How are the sound effects implemented?</strong></summary>

Short audio files (one per action) are imported so Vite bundles and
cache-hashes them. `sounds.ts` keeps one `Audio` object per sound and a
`playSound(name)` function that resets `currentTime` (so the same sound can
retrigger immediately) and calls `.play()`. A `play()` promise can reject —
for example before the user's first interaction — so the rejection is caught
and ignored, keeping sound failures from ever affecting gameplay.

No classes and no `this`: it's just an object of `Audio` instances plus two
small functions (`playSound`, `setSoundEnabled`).
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: How would you add online multiplayer?</strong></summary>

The architecture makes this a small change:

1. **State Structure** - Already separates player and opponent data
2. **Isolated AI turn** - `aiTurn()` in the store is the only place that picks the opponent's move, and it delegates to the pure `getAIShot()` function
3. **Next step** - Introduce an `Opponent` interface so the local AI and a future remote player are interchangeable

```typescript
interface Opponent {
  makeMove(board: Board): Promise<Position>;
}

// Wraps the existing getAIShot() function
class AIOpponent implements Opponent { ... }

// Future: sends board state and awaits the other player's move
class RemoteOpponent implements Opponent {
  async makeMove(board: Board): Promise<Position> {
    return await this.socket.receive();
  }
}
```

> Note: the `Opponent` interface above does not exist yet — it's the refactor I'd do to add multiplayer. Today the AI is a pure function called from `aiTurn()`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: What's the time complexity of the AI's move?</strong></summary>

Each turn is at most **O(n²)** where n = board size (10):

- **Target mode**: dequeuing a cell is O(1); the queue never holds more than
  a handful of neighbors.
- **Hunt mode**: gathering untried cells scans the board once, O(n²), then
  picks one at random in O(1).

So a move is ~100 operations in the worst case — trivial for the browser.
Updating the hunt state after a shot is O(1) (queue a few neighbors).

</details>

### Code Reading Guide

For interviews, I recommend reviewing these files in order:

1. **`types/game.ts`** - Understand the data structures
2. **`utils/board.ts`** - Core game logic (place ships, process shots)
3. **`utils/ai.ts`** - AI algorithms (most interesting!)
4. **`store/gameStore.ts`** - State management and actions
5. **`components/Board/Board.tsx`** - React component patterns
